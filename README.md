# Pegasus Editor
This is the rebirth of a 'small' project that I have wanted to work on for the past few years, a skin editor for the Delta emulator. However now we also have Ignited which has more skin options than Delta, so I would like to also support that as well.

## How?
I am going to try my best to attempt to write this in C with raylib as my first bigger C project. I am no C expert, but I have found myself really enjoying working with it. If you would like to build the project yourself, you only need to ensure you have a proper raylib 5.0 installation as well as a compiler. Clone the project, run `make`, then run the executable!
